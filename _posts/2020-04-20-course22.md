# How course 22 changed my persepctive on AI

I had no idea how easy making image classifiers could be.
But that was before I tried out [fast.ai](https://www.fast.ai/)'s course 22.

Turns out you can just add your own layer of classification weights to an already *highly* advanced *super* powerful pretrained deeplearning network.

And then create my own ridiculously accurate 10 class multiclassification computer vision model.

... with only 2 minutes of training time !

... using nothing but my laptops CPU !

Lets step through the process of how cool of an experience this was.
